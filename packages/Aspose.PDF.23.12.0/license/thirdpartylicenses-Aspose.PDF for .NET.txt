XMP metadata support

XMP Specification
Public Patent License
Adobe Systems Incorporated
The XMP Specification provides a standard format for the definition, creation and processing of
metadata in a variety of applications. Adobe may own patented technology disclosed in the
specification. We offer this patent license to all individuals and organizations in the world in
order to encourage the use of metadata in the XMP format.
Public License
Adobe grants every individual and organization in the world the right, under all Essential Claims
that Adobe owns, to make, have made, use, sell, import and distribute Compliant
Implementations. If a licensee brings (or participates in the bringing of) a lawsuit or similar
action against any other party claiming that a Compliant Implementation infringes an Essential
Claim, Adobe may revoke the rights granted above to such licensee. Upon such revocation, such
rights will be deemed to have never been granted.
No Warranty
The XMP Specification and the license granted above are provided without warranty of any kind,
including warranty of title or non-infringement. Nothing in this document shall be construed as
requiring the maintenance of any patent, a warranty or representation as to the validity or scope of
any patent, an agreement to protect or cooperate with any party or to bring or prosecute actions
against any party, or a grant of any right under any patent claim other than an Essential Claim.
Reservation of Rights
All rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.
Definitions
“Compliant Implementation” means the portion of an application, product, or service that
defines, creates, stores or processes metadata compliant with the XMP Specification.
“Essential Claim” means a claim of a patent, whenever and wherever issued, that is necessarily
infringed in order to achieve compliance with the requirements of the XMP Specification. A
claim is necessarily infringed only when there is no reasonable way to avoid infringement of that
claim when defining, creating, storing or processing metadata.
“XMP Specification” means any version of the XMP Specification published by Adobe. By way
of example only, any specification not published by Adobe or that incorporates the XMP
Specification by reference is not the XMP Specification for purposes of this license.
